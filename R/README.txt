A_run_socsim
THESE SCRIPTS SHOULD BE RUN FROM BERKLEY
As they require SOCSIM compilation
If they have been run in Berlkely, simply copy the
opop and omar output and save it in ../../Data/socsim/
To run the next script

B_compare_model_socsim

If running locally, this should work, provided that the output of the
n simulations was saved in ../../Data/socsim/, from where it is read.
